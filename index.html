        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Emilio Cayambe Profile Picture" width="200">
        <p>I am passionate about computer science. I graduated in my country as a systems technologist, but now
            I want to strengthen my studies to learn my profession in English and have better job opportunities.
            I am happily married and have three children; one of them has already started his own family and blessed
            us with a beautiful grandson. In my free time, I enjoy flying my drone, although I've had to put that hobby
            on hold for a while due to the difficult situation in my country.
